## Tic-Tac-Toe

Last year, I made a basic tic-tac-toe game as a gift for my 10 year old nephew, and we had a blast playing it. This year I've leveled up the game and now is possible to play with a friend or challenge an AI opponent!

I've also improved the UX/UI for a modern feel. Technically, I've moved from using a lot of Vanilla JavaScript to a more efficient React based approach.

These simple yet exciting changes have significantly improved the overall experience, and I hope you like it too. Enjoy playing!

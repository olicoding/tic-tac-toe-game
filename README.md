## Jogo da Velha / Tic-Tac-Toe

Having a virtual Christmas party with my family, came the idea to send my 10 yrs old little nephew, this tic-tac-toe game as a virtual present. It is simple, but made with love.

Credits to my bootcamp at Digital Career Institute, who challenged me with this exercise a few weeks ago, in which I've implemented the JavaScript logic and functionality.

**Future Plans**

- Improve UI / responsiveness
- Add animations
- Add sounds

## Tic-Tac-Toe

Last year, I made a basic tic-tac-toe game as a gift for my 10 year old nephew, and we had a blast playing it. This year I've leveled up the game and now is possible to play with a friend or challenge an AI opponent!

I've also improved the UX/UI for a modern feel. Technically, I've moved from using a lot of Vanilla JavaScript to a more efficient React based approach.

These simple yet exciting changes have significantly improved the overall experience, and allowed me to practice important concepts and improve my skills.

While it's not yet the final version, the current AI implemented is quite simple - a rule-based approach with some strategic decision making. It's not the super smart AI you might have heard out there, but it's a step in that direction. Next, I'll be implementing depth and tree structure, making it even smarter. Stay tuned!
